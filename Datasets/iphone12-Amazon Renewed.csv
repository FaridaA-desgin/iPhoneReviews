"United States",,"2020-11-17","false","10","B08L5P7DYY","4","I have been using iPhones since I was in seventh grade, my first one was the black and space grey iPhone 5, and gradually through the years Apple has continued to upgrade and better the model. The iPhone 12 includes a ceramic shield that will protect the phone from falls and drops from a few feet, triple lens cameras on the back, improved front cameras, a six inch display, come in a asort of colors, etc. The main strengths for this iPhone are its popularity, large screen, and longer battery life. The iPhone is no doubt one of the most widely used and recognized phones out there to date. A lot of people will just get an iPhone despite the fact that other phones can be just as efficient for much less, but no one wants to feel like the one left out. As the years have passed technology has been advancing and becoming a bigger part of our lives so small screens and low battery life are of extreme inconvenience, but with the iPhone 12’s 6.1 inch screen and long lasting battery life there is no need to worry about it. The large screen makes the overall phone look much more appealing and slick while the long lasting battery life promises to be reliable for those that are constantly using their phones, which most are. The main weaknesses of the iPhone 12 include lack of accessories in the box, pricing, and battery usage. The iPhone 12 will be the first line of phones from Apple that will not include a charger or power brick in its box, the company says that they are doing this to be green and save any ‘unnecessary’ material or resources that it would have taken and people are upset by this as that con  joins up with the pricing weakness. Now with the iPhone 12 already making a sizeable dent to one’s finances, they are not also expected to buy their own cables and power boxes should they want or need any more, and along with that, this iPhone has brought the return of the MagSafe chargers which magnetically attach to the back of the phone and charge it faster and more efficiently, however it would cost the owner about $40.00 just to get the charger. One other feature that dulls out the hype for this phone would be the effects of usage of certain applications like 5G data and the cameras built in zoom features, for these features iw would drain the battery a bit faster and could bring the life of the battery from 10 hours down to 6 or 7. I will always be loyal to my iPhone as it has always been a great tool for me and never failed to assist me bothin work and entertainment, so I would say that the iPhone 12 would probably be a must have.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rGsOdMxpL._SY88.jpg",,"32 people found this helpful","The iPhone 12 overall","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJPQ6R2TBH04J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L5P7DYY","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2020","Size: 256GBColor: Black"

From a sleek ergonomic design to high-end features and functionality, 12 offers a great user experience. Some of those features include: Siri (the voice command utility), Safari (Apple’s search engine), Apple Pay (electronic wallet pays system), and FaceTime (video-conferencing App). These features help to keep die-hard iPhone lovers in a state of euphoria.  Apple has outclassed and out-designed most other tech giants with each iteration of the iPhone. The competition is adding various bells and whistles to their smartphones, in an attempt to surpass the popularity and sales of the iPhone. iPhone remains a top resale and trade-back phone due to quality, high rated reviews, workmanship, and the Apple brand. Every product line that Apple offers is seamlessly connected through iCloud. You can start a movie on your MacBook and finish it later on your iPhone. Emails can be sent from an Apple Watch and replies read from the iPad. Staying connected to people and content has never been easier or more portable.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sBiSUt3vL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i8OZ-ug-L._SY88.jpg","One person found this helpful","Two Thumbs Up","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIN76XAJVEJUZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L5P7DYY","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 7, 2022","Size: 128GBColor: Blue"
"United States","🇺🇸","2020-11-09","false","12","B08L5P7DYY","4","The biggest selling point of the new iPhone is 5G. Some backstory, I live in a fairly large suburban city near east of Los Angeles. Because of the population density, I've been looking for a phone that would offer good cellular internet. when away from WIFI. I'm on Tmobile network and around my area, I'm getting around 3 mbps down and 2 mbsp up, that is worse than LTE. When I traveled outside of the major metro areas, I actually had to change service to LTE to get any usable internet at all.Other than that, the iphone works like it should, I noticed it is a bit snappier than my previous XS Max, particularly when snapping to home and opening new applications. Night mode is also something else, very cool feature. One other surprising improvement is that my Earpods and bluetooth devices sound better than before, which may have been due to the new bluetooth technology? The new iPhone is also noticeably lighter than my previous XS Max which felt like a brick. Some other small improves includes a brighter display and dynamic contrast.The biggest cool feature I think they bought back is Magsafe. I can see the myriads of docks, car-mounts, photography gadgets, phone cases, wallets, chargers, stands, tripods, gaming controller, portable battery packs, etc. that can take advantage of the feature.Some negatives I've noticed is with the speakers, maybe it's having to do with weight saving but they don't sound as ""full"" as my previous XS Max. It certainly gets louder but I feel vocals sounds quite tinny compared to before. I'm also not a fan of the HUGE camera cut-out, which seems to have gotten even larger over the years. This is an exposed area most cases cannot protect and will almost certainly get scuffed up easily.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sBiSUt3vL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i8OZ-ug-L._SY88.jpg","22 people found this helpful","5G is practically USELESS, other than that great phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFW0TXK6XPON9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L5P7DYY","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 9, 2020","Size: 64GBColor: Blue"

Besides the fact that... This is possibly the worst looking iPhone thus far. Obviously a close second to the iPhone 3&4. But if you are a die hard fan, I cannot help you. I get it... Once you get used to an iPhone it’s hard to go back because of a learning curve... but if you’ve never had an iPhone and I can save even one person— which I do all the time— from making the switch, the world is a better place. Do not start using iPhone!!! First off no company is very ethical in the making of their phone— as they are all close to human slavery at their streamlined manufacturing plants overseas. Further they get away with everything unethical in the USA... if I sold a car... then after a few years, made a new model. It would be illegal and so wrong for me to go into your garage and ruin the engine, knowing you will buy a new car from me. Yet Apple does this all the time. Yes they have lost lawsuits but they still get away with it— especially in the US but less frequently in Europe. I have personally experienced this, with my current IPhone. Apple wants me to upgrade. I want to upgrade. But when an Apple update takes away my service, I find it extremely unethical. I literally pay for my phone coverage... and my phone (since the millisecond of the new update) shows no service. Someone with my identical phone sued and won for the exact same reason but Apple told me the production number of my phone fell just outside their reimbursements. Secondly... with my last iphone, the new update deleted 500 notes! I had them backed up to google and Google IT proved to me that it was not google but a command from an Apple update that deleted 500 notes. These were not shopping lists but poetry, songs, essays and books that I had begun writing. No amount of money could get those back. I called Apple and they weren’t even sorry... and were of less help than Google when they were at fault. This is 2 major burns from Apple. Do not get an iPhone. If you have an iPhone do not get the update. Also if you are stuck on Apple, get the 11. Better yet—buy it used and for not directly support this company. Also back up your info on a device not attached to Apple at all. Apple is not nice and no help because all they care about is their bottom line. I literally am going to do my research and make a very dedicated exposure video about Apple and hopefully save hundreds of people from buying a phone that’s just going to be sabotaged with an update in a few years.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sBiSUt3vL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61i8OZ-ug-L._SY88.jpg","14 people found this helpful","Apple is not an ethical company.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4PZ7O69JKH2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L5P7DYY","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 1, 2021","Size: 256GBColor: Green"

I have always loved Verizon and I have always lived in the same place.  But I bought the iphone 12 and have had nothing but problems.  Verizon replaced the phone once.  Apple replaced the phone once.  So I have had 3 phones and had each sim card replaced, so 6 sim cards.  NONE of them work.  The worse part is my calls cut out and then they drop calls.  when I'm at home (even though my other 9 phones work fine.  I now have to ask every person who calls me to call me back on my home phone.  And yes - I have been through hours of diagnostics with both Verizon and Apple.  I have turned off 5G and tried w-fi calling (which in my opinion should not be a fix when you can't use your mobile phone to be mobile).  In the process, the diagnostics have caused me to lose ALL my text history, and messed up all my contacts.  I have started from scratch (no transfer of phone information just in case it was me).  And still it doesn't work.  Besides that, the apps don't work correctly.  The apple earpods window (that comes up when you put your earpods in) won't close.  You have to turn the phone and off to get it to close.  websites only use 2/3 of the screen, making it very hard to read.  the phone has a lot of trouble switching from hortizontal to vertical and vice versa.  The scary thing is, I was out of town and had to go to a different Verizon store, and the lady in front of me was complaining about the exact same thing.  She too had her iphone 12 replaced 3 times and those sim cards replaced 3 times and her phone was still not working.
