# iPhone Review Sentiment Analysis and Prediction

# Project Overview
This project aims to use sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment of reviews for an unreleased iPhone model. By analyzing previous iPhone reviews, we can build a model that classifies reviews as either positive or negative. The model can also provide insights into which words or phrases are commonly associated with positive and negative reviews, potentially predicting how users may react to the new iPhone release.

# Key Objectives
Clean and preprocess historical iPhone reviews. Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews. Build machine learning models to predict review sentiment (positive/negative). Generate word clouds for positive and negative reviews. Use models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to predict the sentiment of future reviews.

Project Structure
The project is composed of the following key components:

# 1. Data Preprocessing
Reviews are read from a CSV file.

Text cleaning includes removing special characters, lowercasing, tokenization, and removing stopwords.

Sentiment scores are calculated using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the nltk library.

Reviews are categorized into positive or negative sentiment based on their compound sentiment score.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualization of frequent words in positive and negative reviews using word clouds.

Identification of key patterns in the text that influence review sentiment.

# 3. Model Building
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes models are trained on the cleaned and processed review data.

The models use term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to convert textual data into numerical features.

The models are evaluated using accuracy metrics to determine their performance on predicting review sentiment.

# 4. Prediction
The trained models predict the sentiment of future iPhone reviews.
The prediction outputs are further analyzed for insights into user preferences and potential market response.

# 5. Visualizations
Word clouds are generated to visually represent the most frequent terms in both positive and negative reviews.
Sentiment scores are calculated and displayed for selected reviews to show model performance.
Dependencies
To run this project, the following libraries are required:

nltk: For sentiment analysis using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and train-test splitting.
gensim: For word embedding (Word2Vec).
matplotlib & WordCloud: For data visualization, including word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
imblearn: For handling imbalanced datasets using oversampling techniques.
text2vec (if using alternative approaches): For tokenization and text vectorization in the R version
