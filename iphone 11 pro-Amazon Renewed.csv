"United States",,"2023-03-25","true","1","B08BHHSB6M","5","Quiero dejarles una reseña, aunque no suelo hacerlo pero considero que es oportuno para ayudar a posibles compradores, que al igual que yo estén pensando en adquirir este producto y duden.El producto cumple tal cual con lo que dice, me vino sin casi daños estéticos, un simple golpecito arriba que ni se nota en lo absoluto. Me vino con 91% del estado de la batería, lo cual no me agrada ni me decepciona, ya que te aseguran un mínimo 90%.El cargador es genérico, ya compré uno original y de carga rápida y va de maravilla, aunque tengo que añadir que se calienta más de lo que me gustaría y desconozco el por qué.El dispositivo en general va 10/10 y estoy muy contento con mi compra.Un detalle el cual me hizo pensar en devolverlo es que me vino con el audio ¿se podría decir dañado? No es nada para alarmarse pero se escucha bajo y de mala calidad. Si es algo que me molesta, porque fuera de eso el producto sería un 100/100, no creo cambiarlo, ya que vivo en Uruguay y cambiarlo (aunque tiene una buena garantía de cambio) sería algo negativo y por lo que no quiero pasar. Así que fuera de eso me quedo con mi compra y más que satisfecho.Si estás pensando en adquirir el producto te aseguro que no te vas a arrepentir, da miedo comprar al principio pero vale la pena la espera. Espero ayudarlos con mi reseña.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+U304X2lL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CC3U07cLL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vOHhwddYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hp59YPxaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yxRVH4JlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810A+XsAsiL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OF2BDB25L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qn3OkHX0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oLN6vHZdL._SY88.jpg","6 people found this helpful","Estado del dispositivo","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F48MQQXAB1AO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2023","Size: 256GBColor: GoldService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed Premium"
"United States",,"2022-02-03","true","2","B08BHHSB6M","4","I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT  ) this is very important detail, it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!.  I will also say their after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important.  Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business,  I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation,  Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone,  is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However,  for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with  90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and  as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice  addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors,  I will say as they are sufficient,  I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so  my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending  that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience.  I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation,  Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty,  and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+U304X2lL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CC3U07cLL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vOHhwddYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hp59YPxaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yxRVH4JlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810A+XsAsiL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OF2BDB25L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qn3OkHX0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oLN6vHZdL._SY88.jpg","179 people found this helpful","Great experience, Read for a honest unbiased  however just a few things people should know","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U6LFKDTCOJYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022","Size: 256GBColor: Midnight GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed Premium"

"United States",,"2023-01-04","true","5","B08BHHSB6M","5","This was was an upgrade purchase for my daughter. We don't believe in buying $1,000+ phones for teenagers. Amazon's Refurbished was a welcomed gift! The phone comes well packaged and is in great shape. It works like new, as promised! But, it took us MANY HOURS to finally get this phone set-up and info transfered over. Here are some learned tips for set-up: First, fully charge the new phone and your old phone. If possible, leave them both plugged in during the process. We learned that your old phone needs to be at least 50% charged before it will even start the transfer process. Don't bother backing up your old phone to the iCloud beforehand. It's much faster to wait and do that with the new phone after all is said and done. Your first step, go into the new phone and in Settings, go into General, then update the software to the latest version. We had many issues with the process stalling and then we would finally get an error message? This wasted a lot of time! It's so much quicker to update that software first, though it will take awhile (not lying). Once the software on the new phone is updated, then start the transfer process with your old phone. It will take a while (maybe 30 minutes). Once the whole thing transfers, your new phone will work and everything on the screen will look like your old phone. Here's the one thing we did not think about, you will still need a new SIM card from your Carrier. They are free. Simply go to your Carrier's store and explain that you bought a used phone and they will give you one. After everything is all set-up, call your carrier with your old phone and they will talk you through the process of installing the new SIM into the new phone. They will even test it out with you online until it works. Amazon Refurbished is guarranteed and definitally cheaper than other sites. The phone arrives fast too! After all is said and done, wipe the old phone to factory settings and remove the SIM card. Then you are all set! Newer phone at a cheaper price,  it's guarranteed, and my daughter is totally happy with it!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+U304X2lL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CC3U07cLL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vOHhwddYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hp59YPxaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yxRVH4JlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810A+XsAsiL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OF2BDB25L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qn3OkHX0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oLN6vHZdL._SY88.jpg","51 people found this helpful","Great iPhones, But Set-up Took A Long Time!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U9BJRXG8PB7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","Size: 256GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"

"United States",,"2023-03-11","true","7","B08BHHSB6M","3","These phones are definitely in perfect cosmetic condition, but I think they are because the original owners got rid of them soon after they started to malfunction. I am now on my second iPhone 11 Pro and just found out the camera system is defective.The first phone I got had a blown out speaker and a weird cellular network issue (it keep disconnecting). I thought it was okay that a single used device might have an issue, so I returned it and got another. The new one had better speakers and no network issue, but the telephoto lens doesn't work. And the wide angle lens doesn't activate always.The unfortunate thing is that I sent the first phone back immediately, and unlike other Amazon returns, it can take up to 30 days for the return to be processed. So, I am stuck with a $500 charge on my credit card until they get around to processing the refund.I have bought multiple used iPhones from real people and had a good experience with them. But it seems like Amazon is offloading bad iPhones (although cosmetically perfect and with 90%+ battery) that are either not fully tested, or have defects they hope buyers won't notice.I am going to see about getting a third phone, but if that one is also problematic, then Amazon will get 1 star (because I cannot do zero stars). There are plenty of other places that sell used iPhones, and I am sure some of them have better testing procedures and better return policies.P.S. - The phone itself is great. Great screen, good battery life, etc. Quite a deal in 2023 if you can get a fully functional one for less than half the price of a new iPhone.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+U304X2lL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CC3U07cLL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41vOHhwddYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hp59YPxaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yxRVH4JlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810A+XsAsiL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OF2BDB25L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qn3OkHX0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oLN6vHZdL._SY88.jpg","10 people found this helpful","Buyer beware (review of Amazon, not of the phone)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZF56NZ76GP4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","Size: 256GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed Premium"

Received the phone and battery was 82% the volume down button was Stuck and the speakers on the bottom of the phone did not work. I tried making a phone call and put it on speaker and no voice came out. Same day I received the item I requested a return. They tried offering an 80.00 discount which for a phone over 500.00 was not much. The Carrier picked the Item the next morning and it was delivered to the return facility within a few days. Amazon return policy on the platform when I inquired stated 3-5 business days after the return center receives the item. When speaking to a rep via chat they stated it can take up to 30 days for it to arrive and process a refund from the return center which conflicts with the refund guidelines stated on their FAQ.

So naturally, I made it last as long as I could. My battery is now at 70% health, and dies quite quickly whenever I do anything that isn't texting or calling.Now that the 12s are out, I decided I would get the best last-model, and began searching for an 11 pro. After reading reviews of this seller, I was a little leery to get something that might have visible scratches on the screen, or have hardware/software issues - As you can see in the photos, I have no issues yet. The screen/body are unblemished, and so far, no fatal errors in use. If anything pops up, I will come back and comment.While I feel for the people who had issues with their referbished model arrive with errors, I would recommend it.

The only complaint I have (which is with Apple not the seller nor Amazon) is that the battery health is only 84%. For an iPhone 11 that seems like quite a deterioration. My iPhone 7 was at 84% when I replaced it with this.  It does seem to lose battery life faster than I thought it would.All the apps I use uploaded fine, no problem with the software update. Bluetooth connection worked, connected to WiFi.A generic charging wire and block were included and the phone was totally unlocked and ready for me to link to my prepaid provider. I’ve only just gotten this phone so I will update if it breaks down or has issues. So far, so good.

Portrait mode is only beautiful when there’s plenty of light and the object is still has frozen water. Anything else and the quality is terrible. I heard night mode is beautiful but honestly I don’t see much of a difference from an iPhone 6s! The video quality is great and movements in video is good. I have enjoyed the editing that can be done directly on the phone. I do miss the home button off older versions. This new one uses Face ID which is not always useful as your phone has to be aimed at your face! Most of the time I have to use the passcode.

"United States",,"2021-03-21","true","140","B08BHHSB6M","3","I ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Midnight Green and it looks fantastic, today almost 2 months into use, I have no regrets.Short version:If you want great performance, great cameras, and great battery life, go for it.Not so short version:2 months after my purchase, I am quite happy. I have been using Android since 2013 and today there are almost no options that can compete in the 3 main pillars that interest me: performance, camera and battery.The box it came in was generic (as mentioned on Amazon Renewed), it comes with a also generic charger that charges up to 100% in about 1 hour 30 minutes (I thought it would be worse). It did not have a single aesthetic detail, everything perfect and with a 95% battery health.The options I had were: the iPhone 11 (any version), Google Pixel 5 and OnePlus 8T. What convinced me most of all on the iPhone was the stabilization of the videos, it is something fantastic. Almost all the apps you used on Android are also available on the AppStore and the way iOS works is simply amazing.I was afraid of getting bored, but that was not the case.The only point ""against"" I find is that today the battery health decreased from 95% to 89% (in 2 months), I don't know why, but it still has a good life.I love the photos and the way it handles the HDR, you just open the camera app and shoot, in videos, the best stabilization on a smartphone.If you are looking for performance, cameras and battery, this is the best option. I saw that there are not too many important differences with the 12 or 12 Pro, more than the LiDar sensor and the 5G that for me are not essential.I am very comfortable on iOS and the way everything works. I think I'll stay a long time. I hope it helps you.--- UPDATE July 18, 2022After 1 year and 6 months, the Face ID suddenly stopped working and with that a battery failure, it discharges much faster, I have ios 15.5 and although it shows a health of 88%, after the Face ID failure, it ends 3-4x faster.

He’s older and has never had an iPhone so I was excited for him to finally experience it because I hate his green android text messages. Lol. Unfortunately when we got everything switched over, the phone had lots of issues. He can’t hear on a phone call unless he puts the phone on speaker. The ear speaker has an issue and even with volume all the way up you can barely hear. Also, sometimes his calls work great, but other times the person on the other end says they can barely hear him. It’s very frustrating. I might as well have bought new because I still paid a fair amount for this phone that doesn’t fully work. Of course he is an old man and doesn’t want to bother with switching phones again so he won’t let me return.

The downside there's no apple care if you buy it new, headphones and the original packaging charger. But those you can buy care from a 3rd party or take it to a store for repairs. Headphones you can buy it from a 3rd party also a charger. It will also be less than the original price. Is a good way to reduce clutter for our environment. Phone looks new when opening it was amazing. Had 80% battery life which was amazing. Transfering data is so much easier just by having both devices near to each other. It only works if your device is updated with the latest IOS. I will say kinda bad but not much was the color I order was the dark mint green but I got the gold.

"United States",,"2021-03-03","true","340","B08BHHSB6M","1","I received the phone today and was extremely happy to replace my water damaged iPhone XS witch had mic and FaceTime issues. Once I put my prepaid Verizon SIM card in the new phone, I couldn’t make or receive any calls. I checked my the account and it showed my account was all a sudden suspended. I immediately contacted Verizon customer service and was told my account was suspended because the device was reported lost or stolen by “Asurion”  and can’t be used with Verizon. My SIM card no longer works as it’s been also flagged for using it in a stolen phone, so now I’m stuck without a number until I can go and buy and reactive the SIM card on my old phone.The phone came in great condition no flaws that are easily noticeable. Battery’s life cycle was at a 100%, it didn’t come with the authentic “box” or most importantly the authentic fast charger/cable. The SIM card tray on all iPhones will have a small print of the MEID which will match the MEID in the phones menu. My tray had a completely different MEID to what’s on the phones menu.Don’t be fooled with the high ratings. Most of the issues are not even noticeable to the majority. 9/10 of the iPhones sold from this seller is originally Verizon and blacklisted, BUT! Not the type you would easily notice. Verizon iPhones come factory unlocked from Verizon. If a stolen Iphone doesn’t have iCloud and is unlocked, typically this phone wouldn’t work with any of the major carriers that require the MEID to be linked with the SIM card. However many phones that are reported lost/stolen are sold overseas as most countries don’t tie the MEID with SIM card like we do and one can just plug the SIM card and your ready to go. This also applys to some of the prepaid networks that we have available. If you have one of those prepaid accounts you won’t notice that your phone is actually reported stolen and that once you try to switch carriers you’ll be buying a new phone.Plus, Not to mention that, one would buy an iPhone with insurance and sell it without iCloud. The buyer would be happy for a couple of months until the seller decides to claim it’s lost/stolen and receives a new phone while the other get blacklisted, just like what happed to the phone I received.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mIhen8qlL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"23 people found this helpful","Don’t be Fooled","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R120YFVOYCDK99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","Size: 512GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"

"United States","🇺🇸","2023-01-03","true","150","B08BHHSB6M","2","I received this renewed iPhone 11 Pro and was happy enough with it. Battery was at 80% which was a little lower than I thought but it lasted well enough for me. The facial recognition option to unlock really didn’t work. 90% of the time I’d have to enter the 6 digit code and then randomly it would work. I now have a 12 and it works flawlessly. It was my first iPhone without a fingerprint button so I thought it was just me, so I opted to keep the phone at first. But within the 60 day warranty the toggle switch on the side that puts the phone on silent also broke. I contacted the Amazon who put me in touch with Stone Digital and was really disappointed with the company. Its taken well over 30 days to deal with the issue of returning it. Short messages every few days asking for another small detail of information. I asked for someone to call me so we could just get it sorted and was brushed aside and never received one.  I had to call Amazon several times getting conflicting information regarding the return and had to get quite grumpy with the employee after so much time spent trying to get this resolved. It was a very frustrating experience as the holidays approached. I started the return in November and it’s now January and it still isn’t fully over, I’m awaiting the return to be delivered and accepted for return within the given time allotted so they can close the issue and I am concerned it will again take a long time to manage that and this issue will continue to haunt me.

Also, the screen honestly as pristine and even tiny scratch free (that I get from my purse & pockets) as it was, combined with the teeny bubbles in the back I assume the screen was previously replaced. I have taken enough items to the Apple Store for repairs to know that if they open it and find third party repairs have been made they won’t work on it.This phone had a battery status of “service” so below the 80% stated.

As someone who is constantly on the go and relies heavily on their phone for work and personal use, I was in need of an upgrade and decided to give this renewed version a try.First and foremost, the camera on this phone is truly exceptional. With three 12-megapixel lenses (wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto) it allows for a wide range of photography options and produces stunning, professional-quality images. I've found myself using it more and more for both personal and work-related photography and have been consistently impressed with the results.Additionally, the battery life on this phone has been impressive. I can easily go a full day of heavy use without needing to charge, which is a major plus for someone who is always on the go.Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro, and would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality, reliable phone. The renewed version is a great option for those looking to save some money while still getting a top-of-the-line device.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DZ6RNXCpL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71E6tt4d4FL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,"16 people found this helpful","Apple iPhone 11 Pro: A High-Performing, Professional-Quality Phone at an Affordable Price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IVIB2VM4NAG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 14, 2023","Size: 64GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"

There were a few noticeable scratches on the corners of the phone but the screen and the cameras were not scratched at all. It also came with 85% battery life left. Overall I was incredibly happy with my purchase.However, only after a month of use the display suddenly gave out. The phone was still working as I could use my Apple Watch to send and receive messages, however the screen was pixelated at first and then went completely dark a day later and did not turn back on.Since I am still within my 90 day window I have requested a replacement device. I am a little frustrated since I am without a phone currently and my phone was suppose to arrive 7/14. The last two days I have received emails stating that my device will arrive later than originally expected and it still has not even shipped yet. I will be going out of town this weekend and was hoping to have a phone by then but it is looking like that won’t happen. Clearly have some disappointments.Would love to have been able to rate 5 stars but I am hopeful that when I receive the replacement phone it will work better and last longer than the previous one.

After updating iOS AGAIN via PC and iTunes, we still had a cellular error. Apple support assisted us. We were advised that we had an issue with the iPhone itself and not the carrier. So we were forced to return it and pay more for a replacement. Of course, it was IMPOSSIBLE to make or receive calls or text messages, or cellular data. So it was useless as a cellular phone. I had no other choice. Returned it on Friday July 29 at the Amazon locker at 4925 S Broadway.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61graDBLt1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TQg-ohz1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-oAnxRBOL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wF+y8bqwL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"4 people found this helpful","Great phone, unfortunately defective.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R296GSO9ZR5EG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 30, 2022","Size: 256GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed Premium"

"United States","🇺🇸","2020-08-17","true","246","B08BHHSB6M","4","My renewed iPhone 11 Pro was from Buyspry. While I kept my phone and am very happy with it I gave it 4 stars. I took 1 star off because the screen had some pretty decent sized scratches and I'm honestly surprised they did not try harder to fix that. They had a cheap glass screen protector on it when it arrived and I replaced it with my own. I could kind of see some what appeared to be light scratches but after taking the screen protector off they were pretty bad. If I were someone who did not use a screen protector I would have sent it back. But once I put on my new tempered glass screen protector it really does mask the scratches and I can't even see them.The rest of the body of the phone was in excellent condition, no other scratches or dings. The screen looks great and my battery health is at 100%. I'm sure this will last me for a while. Really the gamble here is probably dependent on who the seller is. But considering how much cheaper it was I don't regret getting this from Amazon Renewed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61graDBLt1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TQg-ohz1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-oAnxRBOL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wF+y8bqwL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"28 people found this helpful","Experience will depend on seller and luck","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QVU3W8NL699O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08BHHSB6M","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 17, 2020","Size: 64GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed"
