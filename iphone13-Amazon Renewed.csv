The other listing available on Amazon for the same specs is priced over $800, that’s way too over my budget, I also considered getting a fresh new green iPhone 13 256GB from Apple Store..but once the 256GB from this seller became available (I refreshed over 2 days haha) I snatched it up, I didn’t double check what condition I would receive because it was only 1 available when I saw it. And I’m so glad I made the purchase! Not one single scratch, not stolen (I looked up the IMEI and found a website to check), battery is 100% and it recognizes my SIM card, same value from buying one straight from Apple Store (if I’m not mistaken with the IMEI screenshot I attached, I think I still have a good half a year warranty with Apple Store!)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519idF2KKYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IGeAsLuLL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614v5tQumaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617B2LxMWbL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H5kWNEi1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Oi2ZjN-HL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mltF1T0UL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ts-5XURAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V-GGzzNGL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mRmUKKyQL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jOgEDdPAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lP0PBDEAL._SY88.jpg","12 people found this helpful","So glad I took a chance on this seller!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GKYWPZNXZ7SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LNFRHGN","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 31, 2023","Service Provider: UnlockedColor: GreenSize: 256GB"

I considered returning the phone and asking for replacement, but these two scuffs did not affect performance at all so I kept it .

"United States","🇺🇸","2022-10-05","false","299","B09LNFRHGN","1","I have used android, iPhone, and crypto phones for the last several years, I would like to say that iPhones and in particular the iPhone 13 are radically behind in every category.usability on this phone is dreadful, it's not easy to use with one or two hands, the Apple keyboard is ridiculously stupid when compared to an android. It's clumsy, it's too small, the auto correct feature Apple has doesn't work.on a Google device if you slide, THE, Google learns that you mean THE, and you teach it how you type or how you speak. Apple devices it seems like the purposefully correct too a sixth grade level.On an android I didn't have to worry about speech rate, or enunciating, because it learned. iPhones and Apple products don't, they stay stupid. There is no adaptation making communication very slow, cumbersome, like you're dealing with a child.The OS, on an iPhone it's an open book. Are used two FA, crypto keys, pins and passwords and an iPhone and Apple product is very literally a hackers wet dream. You can't keep them out, and have to find third-party security in order to be minimally safe in this world.Service and reliability, iPhone has to connect to Wi-Fi for everything, the OS is so slow operating only on cellular data. Any other phone on the market Wi-Fi is a secondary option, for iPhone it's mandatory for basic features.Even with a Wi-Fi connection the OS on an iPhone is comparable to running DOS 3.0, it's slower than dirt, a snail going uphill in a heat storm is faster. YouTube barely loads, tick-tock barely operates, lag is ridiculous and incredible.now when brought to Apple engineers, they said this was normal. That my phones, I tried multiple, that's just how Apple's operate.In summary iPhones are the cheapest and least reliable, pieces of equipment on the market but are the most expensive out there. My advice is to buy anything else if you have to do anything on the Internet at all.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HZhc40HxL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Mp4k6OjXL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W7n263wuL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ai4MdgJ2L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j55JGUFnL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u1QNHqXUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61aLOhfAstL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Why buy an iphone when anything else is better","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ISZCYKM5ZY7F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LNFRHGN","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 5, 2022","Service Provider: UnlockedColor: BlueSize: 128GB"

As someone who values performance, functionality, and style, I was initially skeptical about buying a refurbished phone, but the experience has been nothing short of amazing. Here is my detailed review of the refurbished iPhone 13.Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 has a sleek and stylish design that makes it stand out from other smartphones in the market. The build quality is excellent, and the phone feels solid in your hand. The phone's aluminum frame and ceramic shield front cover make it incredibly durable, ensuring that it can withstand accidental drops and scratches.Performance:The refurbished iPhone 13 performs just as well as a brand new device, thanks to its powerful A15 Bionic chip.

The camera quality is excellent, and the device's image processing capabilities are impressive, resulting in stunning images and videos.Battery Life:The battery life of the iPhone 13 is excellent, and the refurbished device holds up just as well as a brand new device. The phone's battery can last an entire day, even with heavy usage, making it ideal for those who are always on the go.Value for Money:The refurbished iPhone 13 offers excellent value for money. The device is significantly cheaper than a brand new device, yet it performs just as well. The phone is also backed by a warranty, giving you peace of mind that your investment is protected.Environmental Impact:Buying a refurbished iPhone 13 is an eco-friendly choice that reduces e-waste and helps conserve the environment. By choosing to purchase a refurbished device, you are contributing to the reduction of the carbon footprint caused by the production of new devices.Overall, I am incredibly impressed with the refurbished iPhone 13.

Christmas day I tried to set up the phone.  It was stuck in SOS mode in spite of all the troubleshooting and call to Apple 🍎.  AT&T was no help either over the phone.  The phone was a brick.  This isn't my first rodeo being an IT professional for 25+.  I'll assume the phone was tampered with and defaulted to SOS in spite of a valid SIM.  As I was taking it to the AT&T store to see if they could figure it out, my daughter notice a dent and a chip in the phone.  I missed it since I put it in a case immediately. Put the brick back in the box and sent it back.  This was an Amazon refurbished in excellent condition.  In Fair condition at best if it even worked.

I got it all set up and everything seemed to be fine until i tried to making calls, sending texts or using any data outside of my wifi connection.  after a few hours with Verizon tech support and working with Apple it was determined to have a bad cell card and therefore could not connect to anything other than a wifi signal so i erased it and have returned the phone.  it ended up being a fully inspected and certified piece of junk and a huge waste of time.

I was somewhat disappointed that the battery health is already at 92%. The phone itself looks fine, there’s a bit of dirt trapped in some small areas of the phone but no scratches or dents. The package it arrived it wasn’t super protected tho, came basically in a thin cardboard box (like the ones iPhones come in when you actually purchase from apple) that was packaged in a bubble envelope, no further wrapping so I can see how people might’ve gotten it banged up when they received it.Overall it’s a fine phone, the price wasn’t super bad but I’d say it seems more like “good” condition vs. “excellent”.Update as of 12/29/2022: I bought this phone originally on 12/15 and the battery health already dropped to 90%. I make sure not to use my phone while it’s charging and to only charge it during optimal charging times like when it gets to 20% or lower, so I’m bummed the battery health already dropped abit. Makes me worried how low the battery health will drop within the next few months.Update 1/30/2023: Battery died. Lol. If I could clear my phone rn and return it I would, too bad it won’t turn on.

Has problems working at times and like hard time when I am on call to hear me when I Face-Time. Also, it’s not that bad but, recommend Android Phone instead of an iPhone because it has some better quality. I think the iPhone 13 is a good choice to have as a phone. The good qualities that go good with the phone is that it is good for taking a picture of things. I love to use the phone because you can play games that you want and be talking, texting also doing other things on your phone as to having any other phone. Some of the other phones are different but, I think this would be the best choice for you to have. The phone is the best thing to order things also it is fun to be watching videos and other things. You will love it but, also have some bad things about it that you won’t like about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","iPhone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN5ONWJO7VD6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LNFRHGN","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022","Service Provider: UnlockedColor: PinkSize: 128GB"
